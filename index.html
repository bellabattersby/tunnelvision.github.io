    <h2>'An introduction to my myopic state.'</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the void, have a look around, listen to everyone in Sydney tell you their depressed, but you imagine hanging ropes and slitting wrists at the same time you wonder if a boy will ever go down on you, if only you were gay, better see a doctor like mum asked but throw the anti depressants script out and start drinking more and more, account for your age and lack of wealth and fall down the staircase, look over your balcony and see the vomit split, you know you can‚Äôt take dairy but what is a world without blue cheese, cry about your life and ignore the junkies on the street, complain about them stealing mail and have another smoke, book a trip to Canada and cancel it for a boy, go home and feel nostalgic for when you never felt this bad, talk about the demons in your head and watch your parents fade away, make new friends on bumble and try MDMA, feel it not work and you feel yourself escape to the living room and drink half a bottle of vodka and piss off your balcony, think about moving away and then barely pass Astronomy at Usyd, go to a music festival and physically stop yourself from kissing your female friend, go to New Zealand and have an epiphany on the top of a mountain and have no one care, smoke until dinner so you don‚Äôt have to eat lunch, pine over a failed director who shows you his roomates dick on his phone, listen to The Beatles and let your new boyfriends friend explain their significance to you, work with kids and swear a lot, work at a pub and get bullied by an old man, watch a friend throw a knife into a window and laugh it off, let your guard down and have a line, watch your housemates smoke weed whilst watching The Simpsons and cook some pasta, be alone in a house that is always full, bring up wanting to die and your boyfriend just pulls out his bong, a male tattoo artist wont tattoo your hand because you‚Äôre just a young girl, go to work at a vintage store and rate all your employees like dogs at a show, steal a shirt and crop it, start listening to Brian Jonestown Massacre and feel suicidal again, best not to tell those around you incase you begin, drop out of uni and work full time, decide to give up on your Geology/Maths/English degree and move on, book a plane ticket to Melbourne and apply for Creative Writing, get in and have a crack, live with your Aunt and be a cunt, get chlaymdia twice in two months and sinusitis and want to die as the 45+ degree weather deepens your sadness, meet a new friend and they get you a job, work at a nightclub until 6am and then drink until its day, move to Preston and be depreston, develop an addiction to maccas as it‚Äôs down the road, catch the 11 tram until you die, have an en-suite, your ex decides to come and crash on your bed, be late to work and ditch Uni, kick your ex out, have a low period and call your mum who calls your aunt who comes over and drives you to Kmart at 8:00pm to buy you an oil diffuser so you can smell lavender and hopefully it‚Äôll help you sleep again. It doesn‚Äôt. Move out, Northcote is wealthy and new, your housemates are friendly at first, get stuck in a world wide pandemic and have to be locked down with people you will grow to despise, have a 2 hour bath every night, stay in the water until you‚Äôre numb, win an award for your writing and dwell on the photo of you looking fat, more than the prize money ($2,000) in your bank account, fall and slip and hit your head and hope that it‚Äôs the end, ice the bump and drink a bottle of wine, move out quickly and don‚Äôt speak to those housemates ever again, think about egging their house, move to Carlton North and live with 2 psychos again on Amess Street, develop a vomiting problem from sheer stress, be alone and eat pasta and cry for a period of 48 hours, make your Dad scared, make your Mum scared, make yourself scared, suicidal again, go to the doctor and give in, begin taking anti‚Äìdepressants and see your psych every two weeks, kick out one psycho housemate and a nice one moves in and the world begins to open up, drink stolli-bollis and have sex with a girl, get a new pub job, your manager will call you a young little lady, begin to feel upmost disgust at the word girl, she, her, shine at Uni, your anti-Ds make you more confident, make some uni friends, come out as Queer, get more tattoos, quit your job because of the gross old men, no one particularly cares, be unemployed and fall into another lockdown, draw a moustache on your face when you get pissed, another lockdown, remaining pyscho housemate moves out and your friend from Uni moves in, shit your pants in public and walk home with shit running down your leg, get knuckle tattoos, have your tattoo artist tell you they are job stoppers before you get them, tell them to do it, start smoking weed and fall in love, enjoy walking around your house and being with your housemates, come out as non-binary and have some difficulty with people fucking your pronouns up, fuck up your own pronouns, fall into another lockdown and somewhat enjoy it, get a new job at an arcade bar where the people accept you and use your pronouns properly, have your dad be your number one ally when it comes to being non-binary, learn all of the lyrics from Bo Burham‚Äôs Netflix special, buy some expensive Japanese incense and burn it every hour, buy a huge tapestry which is of a tarot card (the 5 of Cups), look ahead and be comfortable in your skin, get a chest tattoo, feel more at home with your breasts, you did contemplate getting top surgery but decide you do like your boobs with a tattoo on them, get stoned and watch a film called ENTER THE VOID which explores drug use and what happens after you die, be shook to your core. Think about when you have been suicidal and think of how the world would be after you died. The same.
